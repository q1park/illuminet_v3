	GENERAL OVERVIEW	-1	31	5	0	0	GENERAL OVERVIEW	6	0	GENERAL OVERVIEW		The VMDS is designed to be operated while mounted in the back of an vehicle or on trailer, while stationary or mobile. It can deploy decontamination solutions into three forms: liquid and foam - with no addition of air into the stream if necessary – up until slurry. The VMMS Power Unit uses an air compressor to create and propel decontaminated solutions through a 1 1 ratio based on a 1 1. This system is designed for rapid, mobile decontaminations missions for terrain and military equipment.

	The VMDS Power Unit uses a Diesel engine-powered air compressor to provide energy to create and propel decontamination solutions through a 1 ½-inch (3.81 cm) pump. It deploys these solutions through vehicle- or trailer-mounted spray bars, a remote-control stanchion-mounted monitor (water cannon) and non-collapsible hoses with D-bale handset(s). The VMDS is capable of drafting from external water sources such as bulk tanks or natural water sources. In addition to the Power Unit, the VMDS incorporates two solution-mixing tanks with fill capacities of 750 gallons each tank. Tanks are constructed with internal baffles to minimize liquid movement and weight shift during transport.	-1	32	5	0	0		6	0	The VMDS Power Unit uses an air compressor to create and propel decontamination solutions through a 1 1

45	The Front Spray Bar is made of stainless steel and consists of three main parts. The middle section is 98 inches long and comes equipped with the mounting brackets as well as two capped ends that are used to attach the right- and left- “wings.”  The mounting brackets are set up to mount the FSB to armored M1083 trucks.  The mounting bracket must be inverted in order to mount the bracket and FSB to the unarmored versions of the M1083 trucks. The FSB comes with two 1 in. diameter pins to hold the brackets onto the clevis fittings on the front of the truck.  The FSB is fed by a 1 in. diameter hose with Green Bands.  The FSB can be used without the extension wings and in this configuration, will cover approximately 16 feet (wide).  Ensure that the caps with gaskets are in place and locked down. Failure to do so will result in liquid spray up the side(s) of the truck.  The right- and left-wings extend the FSB’s overall length by 4-feet (each), 8-feet overall; the spray pattern is approximately 32 feet wide when the wings are extended. The wings can swivel backwards if the vehicle strikes an object on either side, avoiding damage to the FSB or the vehicle. The center nozzles on the middle spray bar and the inner nozzles on the wings point approximately degrees forward from vertical. The outer nozzles on the wings point outward and downward. To add the wings to the FSB, detach the cam-lock caps on ends of the middle section of the FSB and attach the wings using the Instalock cam-lock fittings.  Make certain that there is a rubber gasket in the fitting or it won’t operate properly.  The wings are marked “R” (red bands) and “L” (green bands) and mounted so the inner nozzles point forward at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.	-1	92	7	2	5		15	0	The front spray bar is made of stainless steel and consists three main parts.

If any of the RED LED lights illuminate, the unit is designed to automatically shut down on its own.  This also signals that the power unit started to run outside one or several of the programmed operating ranges.  If the following unit-level troubleshooting methods do not resolve the issue, STOP and always contact maintenance support.  Continued use of the power unit could cause severe damage to the power unit components. The programmable logic control navigation button allows for scrolling to obtain specific engine operational data which monitors the safety cut-off features.  These parameters must be set and adjusted only by qualified service technicians.	-1	404	19	0	0		63	0	If any of the lights illuminate, the unit is designed to automatically shut down on its own.

	STB Slurry is a legacy decontaminant applied onto surfaces such as roads, airfields, parking aprons, pier side, and taxiways.  It is used primarily for terrain decontamination because it is plentiful worldwide and forms a “crust” over the surface where it is applied, aiding in contact time and speeds the decontamination process and weathering effects on terrain. STB Slurry is difficult to mix and keep in suspension for long periods of time, so it is strongly recommended to use (dispense) the batch of STB Slurry within 4 hours of mixing the batch.	-1	433	20	0	0		67	0	"STB Slurry is a legacy decontaminant applied to roads, airfields and taxiways.

	You will need to temporarily replace the air check valve on top of the pump module inside the VMDS Power Unit prior to mixing STB Slurry.

1-	Truck and Trailer The Two-Tank configuration uses both of the 750-Gallon tanks for the STB Slurry mixing operation. The Main (Truck) Tank is used to mix the slurry and the trailer tanks is a source of water for mixing and rinsing the tank.  The availability of rinse water is necessary to help clear any clogged lines and to rapidly flush out the system after discharging the slurry. Using the Tank Selector Valve attached to the rear of the Power Unit, attach the Suction Main (Single Black band) hose to the left side of the Tank Selector Valve and the Trailer Suction hose (Double Black band) to the right. Turn the valve to draw water from the trailer tank as the water source and the turn it back to draw slurry and to mix slurry in the Truck Tank. You can use one of the short discharge hoses (Double Red)  to connect the monitor output and the Agitator hose (Single Yellow) connected to the Agitator output to mix the STB slurry, recirculate and agitate the main truck tank. The White band trailer monitor hose and the double yellow band trailer agitator hose can be used to recirculate water or slurry back to the trailer tank. The trailer suction hose (double Black bands) is used to draw water or slurry from the trailer tank.	2	440	20	0	0		67	0	The main truck tank is used to mix the slurry and the trailer tanks are a source of water for mixing and rinseing the tank.

	When using the truck by itself for mixing slurry, the unit will need to supply water for mixing from an external tank such as a blivet, drop tank, tank and pump unit or out of a natural source.   Make the mixing connections the same way as above for the truck tank but you will be drafting water vertically or horizontally to fill water into the mixing tank. Keep in mind that you cannot perform any other functions (i.e., agitation, or the mixing with the monitor or discharge outlets) when drafting in through the drafting port and out through the draft outlet port. Use the Vertical Draft hose (Single Blue band) to raise water from below the level of the truck tires to draw water up to the Power Unit and into the Main (Truck) tank. Use the Horizontal Drafting hose (Double Blue bands) to draw water horizontally from a drop tank or blivet on the ground.  You can do the same with the Trailer Suction Tank (Double Black bands) to extend the horizontal distance but it might not work for increasing the vertical distance.	-1	441	20	0	0		67	0	Truck will need to supply water from an external tank such as a drop tank, tank and pump unit or out of natural source.

The alternate method is to draft water from an external tank using the drafting function and the draft output port on the back of the Power Unit (white marking port on the back side).  Keep in mind you will not be able to agitate if you are using the drafting function.  The Agitator is connected to the Agitator outlet with the yellow banded hose and uses Selector Valve #1 in “Agitator” mode.  The Hopper/Blender should have the screen on top of the bars to be used in a manner like a “sifter” to help break up any clumps or “dough balls” of dampened STB. A wooden broom stick or other wooden stick is useful for breaking up clumps as well.	2	459	20	0	0		67	0	A shorter 1 1

	When preparing slurry, add the M2 (antisetting compound decontaminating slurry) to the water first. Mix water with M2 antiset for three minutes. Next add the silicone antifoam agent. Mix silicone antifoam agent for at least three minutes before adding the STB decontaminating agent. Prepare the slurry as near to using time as possible. Never prepare slurry more than four hours in advance of use. STB will dissolve more rapidly in hot water; however, STB may foam excessively at water temperatures greater than 110 °F.  Limit starting water temperature to 110 °F or less when possible.  If water temperature must exceed 110 °F (such as if the source water exceeds 110 °F), it is recommended to limit STB slurry batch size to a half batch (158 gallons) to mitigate the effects of excessive foaming.	-1	491	20	0	0		67	0	Slurry should be prepared four hours in advance of use.
