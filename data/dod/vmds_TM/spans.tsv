GENERAL OVERVIEW	12.0	1	-1	252	11
The Vehicle Modular Decontamination System (VMDS) is a modular, diesel-driven system	12.0	0	-1	253	11
specifically designed for rapid, mobile decontamination missions for terrain and military	12.0	0	-1	254	11
equipment.	12.0	0	-1	255	11
This system is designed to be operated while mounted in the back of a vehicle or on a	12.0	0	-1	255	11
trailer, while stationary or mobile.	12.0	0	-1	256	11
The VMDS Power Unit uses a Diesel engine-powered air compressor to provide energy to create	12.0	0	-1	257	11
and propel decontamination solutions through a 1 ½-inch (3.81 cm) pump.	12.0	0	-1	258	11
It deploys these	12.0	0	-1	258	11
solutions through vehicle- or trailer-mounted spray bars, a remote-control stanchion-mounted	12.0	0	-1	259	11
monitor (water cannon) and non-collapsible hoses with D-bale handset(s). The VMDS is capable	12.0	0	-1	260	11
of drafting from external water sources such as bulk tanks or natural water sources.	12.0	0	-1	261	11
In addition to	12.0	0	-1	261	11
the Power Unit, the VMDS incorporates two solution-mixing tanks with fill capacities of 750	12.0	0	-1	262	11
gallons each tank.	12.0	0	-1	263	11
Tanks are constructed with internal baffles to minimize liquid movement and	12.0	0	-1	263	11
weight shift during transport.	12.0	0	-1	264	11
The VMDS can deploy decontamination solutions in three forms: liquid, foam, and slurry.	12.0	0	-1	265	11
Liquid	12.0	1	-1	266	11
– Non-expanded (1:1 expansion ratio) – no addition of air into the stream.	12.0	0	-1	266	11
Compressed Air Foam	12.0	1	-1	267	11
(CAF) - Expanded (up to ~20:1 air to liquid ratio) which is generated by	12.0	0	-1	267	11
on board air injection into the liquid solution.	12.0	0	-1	268	11
This expansion rate can be realized when using	12.0	0	-1	268	11
surfactant-based decontaminant solutions.  CAF is activated using the air control valve on the front	12.0	0	-1	269	11
panel of the Power Unit.	12.0	0	-1	270	11
Slurry	12.0	1	-1	271	11
– Non-expanded, highly concentrated solution that is applied in a thick, cake-batter like	12.0	0	-1	271	11
consistency.	12.0	0	-1	272	11

Front Spray Bar (FSB)	12.0	1	-1	560	24
The Front Spray Bar is made of stainless steel and consists of three main parts.	12.0	0	-1	561	24
The middle section	12.0	0	-1	561	24
is 98 inches long and comes equipped with the mounting brackets as well as two capped ends that	12.0	0	-1	562	24
are used to attach the right- and left- “wings.”  The mounting brackets are set up to mount the FSB	12.0	0	-1	563	24
to armored M1083 trucks.  The mounting bracket must be inverted in order to mount the bracket	12.0	0	-1	564	24
and FSB to the unarmored versions of the M1083 trucks.	12.0	0	-1	565	24
The FSB comes with two 1 in. diameter	12.0	0	-1	565	24
pins to hold the brackets onto the clevis fittings on the front of the truck.  The FSB is fed by a 1	12.0	0	-1	566	24
in. diameter hose with Green Bands.  The FSB can be used without the extension wings and in this	12.0	0	-1	567	24
configuration, will cover approximately 16 feet (wide).  Ensure that the caps with gaskets are in	12.0	0	-1	568	24
place and locked down.	12.0	0	-1	569	24
Failure to do so will result in liquid spray up the side(s) of the truck.  The	12.0	0	-1	569	24
right- and left-wings extend the FSB’s overall length by 4-feet (each), 8-feet overall; the spray	12.0	0	-1	570	24
pattern is approximately 32 feet wide when the wings are extended.	12.0	0	-1	571	24
The wings can swivel	12.0	0	-1	571	24
backwards if the vehicle strikes an object on either side, avoiding damage to the FSB or the vehicle.	12.0	0	-1	572	24
The center nozzles on the middle spray bar and the inner nozzles on the wings point approximately	12.0	0	-1	573	24
45	12.0	0	2	574	24
degrees forward from vertical.	12.0	0	-1	574	24
The outer nozzles on the wings point outward and downward.	12.0	0	-1	574	24
To add the wings to the FSB, detach the cam-lock caps on ends of the middle section of the FSB	12.0	0	-1	575	24
and attach the wings using the Instalock cam-lock fittings.  Make certain that there is a rubber	12.0	0	-1	576	24
gasket in the fitting or it won’t operate properly.  The wings are marked “R” (red bands) and “L”	12.0	0	-1	577	24
(green bands) and mounted so the inner nozzles point forward at an angle of approximately 45	12.0	0	-1	578	24
degrees.	12.0	0	-1	579	24

long overall and will spray a pattern approximately 16-feet wide.  When mounted on the trailer,	12.0	0	-1	589	25
the RSB is fed by two 1 in. diameter hoses with Orange Bands that are connected with a 1-inch to	12.0	0	-1	590	25

Although the tanks are sturdy and supported with internal baffles, do	12.0	0	-1	981	37
not stand on them as they may become very slippery and can create a slip and fall	12.0	0	-1	982	37
hazard.	12.0	0	-1	983	37
The VMDS Version B has two 750-gallon tanks with incorporated skids.	12.0	0	-1	984	37
The 750-gallon tanks	12.0	0	-1	984	37
must always be mounted on either a 5-ton truck or 5-ton trailer.	12.0	0	-1	985	37
For truck mounted tanks, the hose	12.0	0	-1	985	37
attachments must be pointed toward the rear of the truck.  The tanks must always be mounted as	12.0	0	-1	986	37
far forward in the truck bed (touching the front wall) as possible.  There are cutouts in the forward	12.0	0	-1	987	37

the trailer.	12.0	0	-1	997	38
The tanks are built with a 4-way, modular platform skid design which allows 360-degree	12.0	0	-1	998	38
forklifting capability.	12.0	0	-1	999	38
EMPTY tanks can also be lifted from underneath with extended fork forklifts	12.0	0	-1	999	38
or slings and an overhead crane or wrecker and can be loaded from either the rear or the sides of	12.0	0	-1	1000	38
transport vehicles.  Both tanks have an approximate 13-inch notched bottom lip (skid cutouts to	12.0	0	-1	1001	38
the front to accommodate the monitor) on the front ends which butts the tank against the front wall	12.0	0	-1	1002	38
of the truck bed, preventing slippage and damage to the tank itself.  Each tank is equipped with a	12.0	0	-1	1003	38

falling into the tank.  The bars support the removable screen that is used to break up “clumps” of	12.0	0	-1	1035	39
HTH or STB from falling into the hopper and clogging the 1 ½ inch diameter funnel hole.  The	12.0	0	-1	1036	39
removable screen has 1-inch diameter holes and a stainless-steel handle on the top of the screen to	12.0	0	-1	1037	39

If there are “clumps” of decontaminant on the bars or screen, use a disposable dipstick (supplied	12.0	0	-1	1040	39
by the unit) made of wood or plastic to break apart to a size which will allow the clumps to feed	12.0	0	-1	1041	39
through the screen.  DO NOT use a hammer, metal objects, or use excessive force that will create	12.0	0	-1	1042	39

DE-ICER KIT	12.0	1	-1	1052	40
NOTE – Although the De-icer Kits are supplied to keep water in the VMDS tanks from	12.0	1	-1	1053	40
freezing in cold weather, the recommended method of freeze prevention is to drain the tanks	12.0	1	-1	1054	40
(and Power Unit) and to winterize the system, as both tanks can usually be re-filled via	12.0	1	-1	1055	40
drafting in less than 40 minutes (1500 gallons @ 50 gallons/min drafting = 30 mins).	12.0	1	-1	1056	40
The VMDS De-icer features a 24 VDC inverter, powered by a NATO slave connector on the truck	12.0	0	-1	1057	40
source that feeds a GFCI-protected 3000 Watt, 120 VAC output.	12.0	0	-1	1058	40
It is imperative that the vehicle	12.0	1	-1	1058	40
is stationary while conducting this operation, as a grounding cable must be secured from the	12.0	1	-1	1059	40
Inverter to the vehicle chassis to reduce electric shock risk.	12.0	1	-1	1060	40
The heaters can be also powered by	12.0	0	-1	1060	40
shore power, but it is highly recommended that a GFCI-protected circuit is used since the electric	12.0	0	-1	1061	40
de-icing system functions while immersed in water.	12.0	0	-1	1062	40
NOTE - The vehicle’s engine must be running during operation of the heaters or the De-Icer	12.0	1	-1	1063	40
Kit will drain the vehicle batteries very quickly (within minutes).	12.0	1	-1	1064	40
Each VMDS system includes one three-ended extension cords to lead from the inverter to the two	12.0	0	-1	1065	40
(interchangeable) heaters in each tank.	12.0	0	-1	1066	40
One heater is used as a “floater” and the other as a	12.0	0	-1	1066	40
“sinker.”  Unscrew the red float-ring on the de-icer to convert a floater into a sinker.	12.0	0	-1	1067	40
The 500-watt	12.0	0	-1	1067	40
de-icer is normally sufficient to keep the water from freezing.  If ambient air temperature is near	12.0	0	-1	1068	40
freezing but above 25 degrees F, one heater (either float or sink) should be sufficient.  If ambient	12.0	0	-1	1069	40
air temperature is below 25 degrees F, a second heater may be required.	12.0	0	-1	1070	40
WARNING!	12.0	1	-1	1071	40
ALWAYS use the GFCI to protect the De-icer circuit.	12.0	0	-1	1071	40
It is	12.0	0	-1	1071	40
imperative to use a grounding cable attached to the vehicle chassis to reduce the	12.0	0	-1	1072	40
risk of electric shock.	12.0	0	-1	1073	40
The De-icer is an electrical device being operated in or near	12.0	0	-1	1073	40
water.	12.0	0	-1	1074	40
WARNING!	12.0	1	-1	1075	40
A grounding cable MUST be attached from the inverter to the vehicle	12.0	0	-1	1075	40
chassis when operating the De-Icer Kit.	12.0	0	-1	1076	40
Failure to do so drastically increases the risk	12.0	0	-1	1076	40
of electric shock and may result in injury or death!	12.0	0	-1	1077	40
Again, the recommended and easiest method of keeping the tanks from icing over is to simply	12.0	0	-1	1078	40
drain the tanks and winterize the Power Unit.	12.0	0	-1	1079	40
The geometry of the plumbing within the tanks	12.0	0	-1	1079	40
themselves will ensure that most of the water will flow to the lowest part of the plumbing where	12.0	0	-1	1080	40
there is a ball valve at the drain cock.	12.0	0	-1	1081	40

Check the engine oil level and quality by removing the engine oil dipstick (located on the	12.0	0	-1	1372	50
compressor side of the engine).  If the oil level is below the minimum mark on the dipstick, oil	12.0	0	-1	1373	50
will need to be added.  Re-check oil level frequently during the oil adding process ensuring the oil	12.0	0	-1	1374	50
level does not exceed the full mark on the dip stick.  DO NOT OVER FILL.  Mid-point on the	12.0	0	-1	1375	50
dipstick marking area is ideal.  If the oil level exceeds the full mark, oil needs to be drained from	12.0	0	-1	1376	50
the system until the checked level falls below the full mark.  Poor quality oil needs to be changed.	12.0	0	-1	1377	50

The VMDS has several methods of operation which include two (2) discharge hoses with D-Baled	12.0	0	-1	1615	61
handles and nozzle(s), front and rear spray bars and a monitor.	12.0	0	-1	1616	61
There are specific hose connection	12.0	0	-1	1616	61
configurations (see Section 10.2 of this manual) for each specific operational mode.	12.0	0	-1	1617	61
The graphic	12.0	0	-1	1617	61

Refer to Section 2.0 (Location and	12.0	0	-1	1618	61
Description of Operator Controls and Indicators) of this manual for additional system locators.	12.0	0	-1	1619	61
Truck and trailer tanks cannot be used simultaneously.	12.0	0	-1	1620	61
Operator may, however, begin agitation of	12.0	0	-1	1620	61
decontaminant in one tank while conducting mission operations with the other tank.	12.0	0	-1	1621	61
When in	12.0	0	-1	1621	61
DRAFT mode, no other operations are possible.	12.0	0	-1	1622	61
Fill the fluid tank(s).  The fluid tank(s) may be filled by a hose through the hopper blender or	12.0	0	-1	1623	61
straight into the tank.	12.0	0	-1	1624	61
Do not attempt to attach the Power Unit directly to a fire hydrant!	12.0	1	-1	1624	61
During filling operations, monitor the water level at all times by looking in the hopper-blender	12.0	0	-1	1625	61
hole or at the fluid tank level indicator (measuring tape).   Use clean water when possible.	12.0	0	-1	1626	61
If you	12.0	0	-1	1626	61
are drafting from a natural water source, such as a stream, pond or lake you MUST use the strainer	12.0	0	-1	1627	61
and a bucket to ensure that particles and/or debris are not drafted into the system.	12.0	0	-1	1628	61

STB Slurry is a legacy decontaminant applied onto surfaces such as roads, airfields, parking aprons,	12.0	0	-1	2430	85
pier side, and taxiways.  It is used primarily for terrain decontamination because it is plentiful	12.0	0	-1	2431	85

CONFIGURATION OF THE TANKS AND HOSES	12.0	1	-1	2455	87
There are two configurations that the operators may use for mixing STB slurry:  1-Two Tanks (Truck	12.0	0	-1	2456	87
and Trailer) or 2-Single Tank (Truck only)	12.0	0	-1	2457	87
1-	12.0	1	2	2458	87
Truck and Trailer	12.0	1	-1	2458	87
The Two-Tank configuration uses both of the 750-Gallon tanks for the STB Slurry mixing operation.	12.0	0	-1	2459	87
The Main (Truck) Tank is used to mix the slurry and the trailer tanks is a source of water for mixing	12.0	0	-1	2460	87
and rinsing the tank.  The availability of rinse water is necessary to help clear any clogged lines and	12.0	0	-1	2461	87
to rapidly flush out the system after discharging the slurry.	12.0	0	-1	2462	87
Using the Tank Selector Valve attached to the rear of the Power Unit, attach the Suction Main (Single	12.0	0	-1	2463	87
Black band) hose to the left side of the Tank Selector Valve and the Trailer Suction hose (Double	12.0	0	-1	2464	87

Turn the valve to draw water from the trailer tank as the water source and	12.0	0	-1	2465	87
the turn it back to draw slurry and to mix slurry in the Truck Tank.	12.0	0	-1	2466	87
You can use one of the short	12.0	0	-1	2466	87
discharge hoses (Double Red)  to connect the monitor output and the Agitator hose (Single Yellow)	12.0	0	-1	2467	87
connected to the Agitator output to mix the STB slurry, recirculate and agitate the main truck tank.	12.0	0	-1	2468	87

2-	12.0	1	2	2472	87
Truck only	12.0	1	-1	2472	87
When using the truck by itself for mixing slurry, the unit will need to supply water for mixing from	12.0	0	-1	2473	87
an external tank such as a blivet, drop tank, tank and pump unit or out of a natural source.   Make the	12.0	0	-1	2474	87
mixing connections the same way as above for the truck tank but you will be drafting water vertically	12.0	0	-1	2475	87
or horizontally to fill water into the mixing tank.	12.0	0	-1	2476	87
Keep in mind that you cannot perform any other	12.0	0	-1	2476	87
functions (i.e., agitation, or the mixing with the monitor or discharge outlets) when drafting in through	12.0	0	-1	2477	87
the drafting port and out through the draft outlet port.	12.0	0	-1	2478	87
Use the Vertical Draft hose (Single Blue band)	12.0	0	-1	2478	87

Main (Truck) tank.	12.0	0	-1	2480	87
Use the Horizontal Drafting hose (Double Blue bands) to draw water horizontally	12.0	0	-1	2480	87
from a drop tank or blivet on the ground.  You can do the same with the Trailer Suction Tank (Double	12.0	0	-1	2481	87
